# Network Navigator

This repository contains the code for *Network Navigator*, a browser tool designed for network analysis and built with humanities data in mind. It's meant as a bird's-eye-view of network metrics and some standard visualization forms, a way of exploring network data in classroom or research settings. Our intention is to emphasize the useful measurements and statistics that can be drawn from network data, while still providing the visualization tools offered by other network analysis software. *Network Navigator* was first released in 2017; the site was redesigned, expanded, and re-released as v2.0 in 2021.
